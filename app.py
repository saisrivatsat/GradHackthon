            ### What is MindMate?

            **MindMate** is an AI-powered mental health detection and support system built to help individuals understand, track, and respond to their emotional well-being. With the power of **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **sentiment analysis**, it can identify early signs of:

            - Depression  
            - Anxiety  
            - Stress  
            - Bipolar Disorder  
            - Personality Disorders  
            - Suicidal Ideation  

            The app supports both text and audio inputs, allowing users to express their emotions in the way that feels most comfortable for them. It not only detects potential mental health concerns but also provides practical suggestions, empathetic responses, and emergency safeguards—offering timely help when it matters the most.

            ### Problem Statement

            Mental health issues are often invisible but deeply impactful:

            - Over 280 million people suffer from depression globally.
            - Suicide is among the leading causes of death for youth.
            - Many suffer in silence due to stigma, lack of access, or fear.
            - Therapy and psychiatric care are expensive or out of reach for many.

            Traditional systems are reactive. MindMate is proactive—offering immediate, private, judgment-free mental health insights 24/7 using either text or audio input from the user.

            ### Features that Make a Difference

            #### Real-Time Mental Health Prediction
            - Based on a trained Logistic Regression model
            - Supports both text and audio inputs, analyzed in seconds
            - High accuracy for key mental health conditions

            #### Confidence-Driven Insights
            - Prediction comes with a confidence score (0-1)
            - Clearly labeled as:
                - Low Confidence (< 0.6) - No alert, avoid false positives  
                - Moderate Confidence (0.6–0.85) - Suggest monitoring  
                - High Confidence (≥ 0.85) - Serious attention needed  

            #### Crisis Alert System (Life-Saving Feature)
            - If the detected state is "Suicidal" and confidence is ≥ 0.50
            - AND the user has opted-in + added a guardian contact
            - Then:  
            An automated WhatsApp emergency alert is sent to the contact  
            Message reads: "A high suicide risk score has been detected. Please reach out to your loved one and provide support during this time."

            #### Personalized Chatbot with Sentiment Understanding
            - Uses NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
            - Offers context-aware supportive responses
            - Suggests guided meditation YouTube videos specific to the detected state

            #### Visual Prediction Probability
            - Interactive bar chart showing prediction probability across all classes
            - Enhances transparency in how decisions are made

            #### Tailored Suggestions
            - Practical advice based on prediction:
                - Journaling
                - Breathing exercises
